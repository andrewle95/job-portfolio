          <p>
            I studied and graduated from the University of California Irvine,
            with a degree in Software Engineering. Going into college, I did not
            know what the field of computer science consisted of. However, I
            slowly began to love the subject. I loved the idea of being able to
            create anything the mind can design with just the power of a
            computer. However, due to the fact that other students came in with
            more resources than I had, I was hit with a huge culture shock. I
            was competing with students his age who had much greater knowledge
            of computer science than he had because of the lack of resources I
            received coming from a low income latino based community.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite the competition I got a job at Teens Exploring Technology, I
            knew this was the place where I can make a change. With a passion in
            computer science, I was able to introduce computer science and
            programming to low income students. I created opportunities for
            students living in disadvantaged communities to learn about the
            different options college provides, like computer science.
