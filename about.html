          <p>
            Throughout my life, I have always been fascinated with technology. I
            loved tinkering with technology no matter what the purpose was.
            Whether it was working on optimizing my computer, setting up servers
            for my friends, to finally being able to develop my own programs and
            applications, I always took on the challenge and learned something
            new. In every job I have taken, I have brought with me this passion
            and provided the companies I was part of IT solutions and
            efficiency.
